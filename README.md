# MongoDB
A clustered example of MongoDB running via docker.  I made this so I can get used to some basic mongodb administration and maintenance stuff.

## Getting Started

The mongodb service will forward it's published port to host port 27017. Make sure the port is not in use or change it to a different port.

### Start mongodb (first time only)
  ```
  setup.sh
  ```

### Start mongodb

  ```
  docker-compose up mongodb
  ```
